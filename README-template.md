## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt that when attempting a challenge using css grid that it is a good practice to specify the columns only and not the rows unless you want to explicitly contain elements within a certain location. Secondly if you would like to have a border radius around a card then you can utlize the css ```border-radius``` property. Lastly, if you would like to center content in the middle of the screen then you can use the css declaration ```margin: 0``` which should center the content in the middle of the screen.



### Continued development

I found that css grid has a property called ```order``` which is quite powerful in terms of determining the order of items within a grid so I plan to use this particular property in future projects that require items to be ordered differently to get better at using it in seemingly difficult solutions.


### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me with the flexbox concept and I am really glad to be recommend this article, will use it going forward.

- [MDN CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is the guide to all the css properties with an indept explanation. Definitely recommend it.
